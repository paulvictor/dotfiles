;;; early-init.el --- Emacs early init -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs 27 introduced early-init.el, which is run before init.el, before
;; package and UI initialization happens.

;;; Code:

(defconst emacs-start-time (current-time))

;; Uncomment this to debug.
;; (setq init-file-debug t)
;; (setq messages-buffer-max-lines 100000)

;; If an `.el' file is newer than its corresponding `.elc', load the `.el'.
(setq load-prefer-newer t)

(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 20 1024 1024))

;; the file, but during startup, it wonâ€™t need any of them.
